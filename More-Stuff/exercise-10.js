/**
 * # Exercise 10 #

 * Task: Consider this code:
 * 
 * > let x = "5"
 * > x = x + 1
 * = "51"
 * 
 * Now, consider this code:
 * 
 * > let y = "5"
 * > y++
 * 
 * What gets returned by y++ in the second snippet, and why?

 * Solution: The integer `5` is returned by `y++` in the second snippet because the `++` operator coerces the string `'5'` into an integer.
