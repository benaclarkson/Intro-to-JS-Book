/**
 * # Exercise 11 #

 * Task: What value does the following expression evaluate to?

 * parseInt('3.1415')

 * Solution 1:
 * The above expression evaluates to the `3` due to the fact that the `parseInt()` method only converts string representations of digits. Once it encounters a non-digit--the `.` in this instance, it stops executing.
