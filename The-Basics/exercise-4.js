/**
 * # Exercise 4 #

 * Task: Explain why this code logs '510' instead of 15.

 * console.log('5' + 10);

 * Solution 1:
 * The above code logs the string '510' instead of 15 due to implicit coercion of the Number data type 10 into a String data type, which is then concatenated with the String '5'.
