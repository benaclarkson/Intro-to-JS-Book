/**
 * # Exercise 7 #

 * Task: Will an error occur if you try to access an array element with an index that is greater than or equal to the length of the array? For example:

 * let foo = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
 * console.log(foo.length);  // => 3
 * console.log(foo[3]);      // will this result in an error?

 * Solution 1:
 * An error will not occur, but `undefined` will be returned.
